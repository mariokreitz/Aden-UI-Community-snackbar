# ADEN UI WORKBENCH

The **Aden UI Workbench** is a specialized laboratory for Angular
developers to build, test, and preview components in a native Aden UI
environment.\
This project ensures that every community contribution aligns with
architectural standards and design language before it gets featured on
the official platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you start crafting, ensure you have the following installed:
-   **Node.js**
-   **Git**


## Quickstart

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the GitHub page to create
your own copy.

### 2. Clone your Fork
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aden-ui-community.git
cd aden-ui-community
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

### 4. Launch the Workbench
``` bash
ng s -o
```

Access the environment at:
    http://localhost:4200


## Project Structure
This project is structured to keep the workbench engine separate from
your creative work.

    |   |-- 📁 shared/             <-- Shared Workbench Components
    |   |-- 📄 app.routes.ts       <-- Routing configuration
    |-- 📄 angular.json            <-- Build & PrismJS configuration
    |-- 📄 package.json            <-- Dependencies


## Usage & Workflow

### 1. Developing your Component

Open:

    src/app/contributions/my-contribution/

This folder is pre-configured with the `<app-ui-playground>` wrapper.\
Edit the files and see your changes instantly in **Lab Mode**
(`/workbench`).

### 2. Handling Metadata

Inside your component's `.ts` file, you must fill out the `meta`
object.\
This data generates the header in the playground:

-   **Title** -- Name of your component\
-   **Description** -- Short explanation of its purpose\
-   **Username** -- Your Aden UI username for credits

### 3. Multiple Components

If you want to submit multiple elements, generate a new component:

``` bash
ng generate component contributions/your-component-name
```

To preview it, swap the selector in:

    src/app/pages/workbench/workbench.component.html


## Technical Requirements

To ensure your component is accepted for the Aden UI library, it must follow these rules:

- **Standalone**: All components must be `standalone: true`
- **Signals**: Use Angular Signals for state management (`input()`, `computed()`, `signal()`)
- **Playground**: The component template must be wrapped in `<app-ui-playground>`
- **Required Workbench Variables**: The variables `codeHtml`, `codeScss`, `codeTs`, and `installCode` must be filled with the final, production-ready code. These are used to generate the live preview, provide copy-paste snippets for other developers, and generate installation instructions. They must not be left empty or contain placeholder content.


## Submission Process

Once your component is polished and ready:

### 1. Commit your changes

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added [component name]"
```

### 2. Push to your Fork

``` bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Submit URL

Copy the URL of your GitHub Fork and paste it into the contribution form on:

    https://adenui.com/contribution
